# 📝 Task Management App

A simple React-based Task Management App built with Vite, TypeScript, and Material-UI. It demonstrates state management with Context + useReducer, mock API integration, optimistic UI updates, and persistent storage with `localStorage`.

# About

## Features:

- Add, Edit, Delete tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- Filter tasks by All / Completed / Pending
- Persist tasks across reloads with `localStorage`
- Fetch initial tasks from JSONPlaceholder mock API
- Optimistic UI updates for a smooth experience
- Responsive & mobile-friendly UI with Material-UI

## Tech Stack:

- React 18 + Vite (fast dev env)
- TypeScript (type-safe dev with strict type assertions)
- React Context + useReducer (state management)
- Material-UI (UI components & styling)
- JSONPlaceholder (mock API backend)
- localStorage (persistent state)

# Design Decisions

- React Context + useReducer → Simple, predictable state updates without Redux overhead.

- localStorage + API merge → Keeps tasks persistent while still syncing initial API data.

- Optimistic UI → Makes the app feel instant, even if API fails.

- Material-UI → Quick, responsive styling with minimal CSS. Created reusable components with MUI, but imported directly from the library modules to improve performance and reduce bundle size.
